# Cars and Drivers
A class demo fro JSS, emphasizing work with the `http` module in Node to create a server.

## Endpoints:
We have created the following endpoints:
- `GET`
    - `/cars`: Returns a list of all cars.
    - `/drivers`: Returns a list of all drivers.
- `POST`
    - `/cars`: Echoes a car object back to the client.
